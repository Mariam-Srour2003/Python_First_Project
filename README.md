# Python_First_Project
# Retirement Pension and Compensation Calculator

This repository contains my first Python project submitted for the course COMP305: Advanced Programming, Spring 2022-2023.

## Project Structure

- **python-project:** Project directory.
- **README.md:** Project documentation.
- **advanced programming project.docx:** Additional project documentation.

## Overview

In partial fulfillment of the course Advanced Programming, this Python project serves the purpose of facilitating the process of calculating retirement pensions or compensations for individuals in the educational structure of private schools.

The project aims to assist employees in accurately calculating compensatory salaries or retirement pensions based on confirmed conditions required for this service. It considers multiple laws and the duration of work to calculate the amount to be paid to the individual.

## Functionality

### User Input:

1. Full Name
2. Date of Birth
3. Start Date of Employment
4. End Date of Employment

### Processing:

- The program calculates the number of years worked and the current age.
- It excludes years of work prior to turning 18 and after reaching the age of 64.
- The system calculates the legal salary based on laws and grades.

### Retirement Pension Conditions:

- Age should not be less than 55 years.
- Duration of work should not be less than 30 years.

### Compensation Conditions:

At least one of the following conditions must be met:

1. For females, they must be married.
2. The duration of education should be more than 25 years.
3. They should have reached the age of 64.
4. They should have a medical condition.
5. They should be deceased.

### Calculation:

- The system calculates the legal salary based on laws and grades.
- Different certificates have different calculations.
- The legal salary is determined based on grades and certificate type.

### Output:

- For Retirement Pension: 85% of the legal salary.
- For Compensation: Equal to the legal salary.

### Additional Features:

- System handles incorrect or invalid dates gracefully.
- Option to explain how the calculation was performed.

## Usage

1. Run the Python program.
2. Input the required information in the GUI form.
3. View the calculated retirement pension or compensation.
